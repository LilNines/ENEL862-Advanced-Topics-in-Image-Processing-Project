# Vehicle Motion Analysis ‚Äì ENEL 862 Project  

## üìå Project Overview  
This project analyzes the motion of a **Honda CR-V (1998 model)** as it moves across a parking lot and over a speed bump. Using **video analysis techniques in MATLAB**, the study estimates the vehicle‚Äôs speed, wheel displacement, body movement, and the effect of passenger load on suspension response.  

Three sets of videos were analyzed:  
- **No bump**  
- **Small bump**  
- **Large bump**  
Each set includes five trials with increasing numbers of passengers (1‚Äì5).  

The goal was to extract as much quantitative information as possible about the CR-V‚Äôs motion from video data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology  
1. **Pixel-to-Centimeter Conversion**  
   - Vehicle length (front light ‚Üí rear tire) was measured in pixels.  
   - Real-world length was obtained from manufacturer specifications.  
   - Conversion ratio: **~1.25 cm/pixel**.  

2. **Speed Estimation**  
   - Rear tire tracked across frames.  
   - Instantaneous speed calculated from displacement vs. time.  
   - Average speed ‚âà **181.2 cm/s**.  

3. **Wheel & Body Displacement**  
   - Applied **Hough Transform** to detect circles (lights, wheels).  
   - Wheel vertical movement ‚âà **7.67 cm**.  
   - Body vertical movement ‚âà **1.25 cm**.  

4. **Speed Bump Height Estimation**  
   - Estimated from wheel displacement ‚Äì body displacement.  
   - Speed bump height ‚âà **6.41 cm**.  

5. **Passenger Load Effect**  
   - More riders ‚Üí increased suspension compression.  
   - Wheel displacement changed slightly.  
   - Body displacement increased more significantly with passenger count.

## üìä Results Summary  
- **Pixel-to-cm ratio:** ~1.25 cm/pixel  
- **Average speed:** 181.2 cm/s  
- **Wheel displacement (vertical):** 7.67 cm  
- **Body displacement (vertical):** 1.25 cm  
- **Speed bump height:** 6.41 cm  
- **Passenger effect:** Higher load ‚Üí more body displacement
